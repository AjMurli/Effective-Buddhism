                <h5>"Buddhism is an amazing philosophy full of wisdom with great truths"</h5>
                <p>Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply meditate. The idea is to relinquish
                    attachment to earthly desires in order to DO MORE. Not to meditate all day to do nothing. In an
                    effort of learning all teachings, we will re-evaluate the core values, and give a new perspective
                    based on the teachings. The core re-evaluation leads us to the idea that Nirvana is something to
                    achieve in this realm. And that leaving this realm is a negative desire in it of itself.</p>

                <p>To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is failed to be recognized by modern Buddhist
                    society. Outreach is a non-factor. So many people who need this valuable information are left in the
                    dark, with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual progress using technology (tools to increase impact)
                    are completely disregarded.</p>
                <p>Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to renounce. But here s what the true text says
                    “**Desires** for tangible things (such as wealth, property, or other material goods) or for
                    pleasures of the body (such as sexual activity, gluttony, or other hedonistic pursuits). Buddhism
                    teaches us to try to let go of our **worldly desires**, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of
                    enlightenment.”As it says, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of enlightenment.

                <p>
                    Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not even know how consciousness works yet.
                    To learn all teachings, we need to learn by the act of doing. There is no better thing to learn at
                    this time, than how to spread change like Buddha did.
